This formula is for your bed and breakfast stay when you use one bedroom with one double bed and a private bathroom. There is also the possibility with some bedrooms to add an additional bed. The use of the kitchen is not normally possible but, in certain cases, depending on availability, it may be possible for us to arrange the use of the kitchen. Your stay includes breakfast, which is included in your price.
