The "Aiole" country guest house, located in the municipality of Castiglione d'Orcia, is situated at the heart of various sites which are famous for their history, cultural importance and beauty.It is located along the Grossola Provincial road and is surrounded by woods; the house overlooks the the Orcia Valley, which is surrounded by towns such as Montalcino, Pienza, S. Quirico d'Orcia, Bagno Vignoni, Montepulciano and various other points of interest including 
ancient villages, castles and abbeys. The farmhouse, completely restructured in typical Tuscan style, has six double rooms, all with private bathrooms and showers; and given its location, it offers a guaranteed opportunity for relaxation in a rustic, and at the same time comfortable and refined, environment.
